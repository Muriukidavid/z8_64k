minimum zilog z8 64k 80-pin board bring up C code. very general with a few peripheral devices: ADC, PWM, UART and an LCD. Does not use the Zilog ez8 library files. I cannot stand cryptic names for registers and devices in those files, and i tend to not remember things i dont have to, so...  here we are. Its kinda nice start code for any zilog embedded project, if anyone is still using those. 

This is no longer being developed as I have moved to ARM based devices.
